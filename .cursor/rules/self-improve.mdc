## CRITICAL GLOBAL FORMATTING RULE

**NEVER USE EM DASHES (—) IN ANY CONTENT, EVER.**

This is a hard requirement with zero exceptions that applies to:
- All chat responses
- All file contents (code, markdown, text, etc.)
- All comments
- All documentation
- All generated content of any kind

**Always use regular hyphens (-) or restructure sentences instead.**

Before generating ANY content, ensure no em dashes are used. This rule takes precedence over all other formatting considerations.

## Rule Improvement Triggers

- New code patterns not covered by existing rules
- Repeated similar implementations across files
- Common error patterns that could be prevented
- New libraries or tools being used consistently
- Emerging best practices in the codebase

# Analysis Process:
- Compare new code with existing rules
- Identify patterns that should be standardized
- Look for references to external documentation
- Check for consistent error handling patterns
- Monitor test patterns and coverage

# Rule Updates:

- **Add New Rules When:**
  - A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
  - Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
  - Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
  - New security or performance patterns emerge

- **Modify Existing Rules When:**
  - Better examples exist in the codebase
  - Additional edge cases are discovered
  - Related rules have been updated
  - Implementation details have changed

- **Example Pattern Recognition:**

  ```typescript
  // If you see repeated patterns like:
  const data = await prisma.user.findMany({
    select: { id: true, email: true },
    where: { status: 'ACTIVE' }
  });

  // Consider adding to [prisma.mdc](mdc:shipixen/.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc):
  // - Standard select fields
  // - Common where conditions
  // - Performance optimization patterns
  ```

- **Rule Quality Checks:**
- Rules should be actionable and specific
- Examples should come from actual code
- References should be up to date
- Patterns should be consistently enforced

## Continuous Improvement:

- Monitor code review comments
- Track common development questions
- Update rules after major refactors
- Add links to relevant documentation
- Cross-reference related rules

## Workspace Information Capture

- Follow [conversation-capture](@conversation-capture) to automatically update workspace during conversations
- Capture new projects, achievements, skills, and preferences as they emerge
- Update existing files rather than creating duplicates
- Maintain quality by following templates and metadata conventions

## Rule Deprecation

- Mark outdated patterns as deprecated
- Remove rules that no longer apply
- Update references to deprecated rules
- Document migration paths for old patterns

## Documentation Updates:

- Keep examples synchronized with code
- Update references to external docs
- Maintain links between related rules
- Document breaking changes
